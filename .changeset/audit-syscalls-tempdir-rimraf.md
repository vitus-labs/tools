Audit fixes — three proven issues, each measured and regression-tested.

**1. atlas: scanner N+1 `statSync` (perf)** — `listDirectories` called `statSync` once per directory entry. Now uses `readdirSync(base, { withFileTypes: true })` and only falls back to `statSync` for symbolic links (which `Dirent.isDirectory()` can't resolve). Measured on a 65-entry workspace: **65 → 5 syscalls (92% fewer)**, identical directory output including symlinked package dirs (regression-tested).

**2. rolldown: temp-dir leak on error path (resource leak)** — `buildDtsIsolated` removed its `__dts_tmp_*` directory only on the success path. If the DTS build or any post-processing step threw, the temp dir leaked into `lib/` and shipped in the published package (`files: ["lib"]`). Cleanup is now in a `finally` block. Proven by a test that fails on the old code (0 cleanup calls) and passes after.

**3. rolldown + rollup: drop the `rimraf` dependency** — both packages require Node ≥ 22, where the built-in `fs.rmSync(path, { recursive: true, force: true })` does exactly what `rimraf.sync` did. Removed `rimraf` as a direct dependency from both packages — one fewer runtime dependency and supply-chain surface, zero behavior change.

No memory leaks were found. Four separately-reported correctness concerns (depth-map inversion, cycle self-loop handling, bundle-size I/O, transitive-size dedup) were investigated and disproven by tracing the actual code — no changes made there.
